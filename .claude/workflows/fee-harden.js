Named AI-tone patterns to hunt (both languages):
- Negation tricolon: "buttons do not respond, forms do not validate, dynamic
  components do not update" / 「按鈕不會回應點擊、表單不會驗證、動態元件不會更新」
- "not X but Y" contrast framing: "The question is not whether to hydrate, but..."
- Em-dash appositive chains stacking three-plus glosses in one sentence
- Paragraph-final summary flourishes that restate the paragraph
Fix rule: replace the pattern with ONE concrete example or a plain statement.
Rewording the pattern into a fresh tricolon or contrast is a failed fix.`

const SCOPE_RULE = `
Scope discipline (hard rule): edit ONLY the file(s) named in this prompt.
Do not touch docs/en/list.md, docs/zh-tw/list.md, other articles, configs,
or anything else, even if you notice problems there — report them in your
notes instead.`

function auditPrompt(a) {
  return `You are auditing one documentation article, reader-first. Article:
${a.enPath} (EN) and its mirror ${a.zhPath} (zh-TW). Read CLAUDE.md first for
the canonical template and conventions.
${opNote(a)}

Step 1 — READ AS A READER. Read the EN article start to finish once, as a
senior frontend engineer trying to learn from it. Record where you stumble,
every term used before it is introduced, and every question the text provokes
but does not answer. Skim the zh-TW mirror for parity and translated-AI-tone.

Step 2 — VERIFY. Go back and check load-bearing claims against the article's
own References plus official docs (WebFetch/WebSearch). Flag claims the cited
sources contradict, stale version claims (today's world, not the world at
writing time), and dead URLs. Check whether cited sources contain concepts
the body should absorb, and whether references use terms the body never defines.

Step 3 — SWEEP THE ECOSYSTEM. Search beyond the article's own References:
what would a practitioner in today's ecosystem expect this article to cover?
Flag as findings (a) major implementations, libraries, or spec developments
the article omits entirely, and (b) widely-cited, high-quality community
articles on this topic whose insights the article should absorb — name the
specific source and the specific insight worth folding in. An article that
only restates official docs is under-researched by this repo's standards.

Report findings in these lenses, priority order: tone (highest), organization
(dependency check / provoked-question check / framework neutrality /
MOTIVATING-PREMISE check: is the audience or scenario the article claims as
its reason to exist real, or invented to justify the content? A comparison
or mechanism study is allowed to exist for its own sake — if the premise is
fiction, the finding's fix is to reframe the article around its genuine
motivation, not to delete one sentence), references (mining + terminology
alignment), factual, template (mechanical checklist: section order vs
CLAUDE.md, frontmatter, Vue template safety).

the article's core promise; major = a reader acting on it gets burned; minor
= polish.`

template. Preserve what the audit praised; do not rewrite untouched sections.
${TONE_BLACKLIST}
${SCOPE_RULE}
For organization findings, answer the reader's provoked questions in place
(add the missing paragraph or gloss); introduce every proper noun at first
substantive use. For factual findings, base corrections only on the sources
the audit cites — do not add new unsourced claims. You may decline a finding
you believe is wrong; record it in "declined" with a reason.

assume every ADDED claim is wrong until a primary source proves otherwise
(WebFetch/WebSearch official docs — never blogs echoing each other), and
check whether the edits introduced NEW tone violations or reader-model
regressions (a term now used before introduction, a new unanswered question).

edited one? Read-only: do NOT edit any file. Verdict "clean" only if no
finding survives your honest effort to refute.`

${opNote(a)}
Apply every EN change at the corresponding location in the zh file,
translated naturally into Traditional Chinese (Taiwan). Match the zh file's
existing terminology and punctuation conventions. Do NOT reintroduce AI-tone
patterns the EN edits removed (no negation tricolons, no 「不是X,而是Y」).

In addition to mirroring the EN diff: the audit findings below may include
issues specific to the zh-TW file (zh-only tone violations, translation
drift). Fix those in the zh file too, and report each of them in the
zhFixes field of your structured output.

Audit findings:

${SCOPE_RULE.replace('file(s) named in this prompt', `zh-TW file ${a.zhPath} only`)}
After editing, re-read the changed zh sections once and confirm section count
and order still parallel the EN file. Full orthographic correctness for
Traditional Chinese is required.`
